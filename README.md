# About
A tool created to take high resolution screenshots of iRacing without having to use Nvidia DSR.
Created using Electron and Vue.

# Features
* A wide range of resolutions to choose from, including custom resolutions
* Auto Crop the iRacing watermark - user must resize iRacing UI to smallest size
* Global Screenshot Hotkey (Control+PrintScreen)
* Track and Driver Names included in filename, so you can keep track of screenshots easier

# Limitations
* iRacing must be run in Borderless Windowed mode
* iRacing may run out of VRAM at higher resolutions causing the game to crash (8GB VRAM should be enough for 8K resolution in most situations)
