# About
A tool created to take high resolution screenshots of iRacing without having to use Nvidia DSR.
Created using Electron and Vue.

# Limitations
* iRacing must be run in Borderless Windowed mode
* iRacing may run out of VRAM at higher resolutions causing the game to crash (8GB VRAM should be enough for 8K resolution in most situations)
